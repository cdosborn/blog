*Like to install the latest version of X?*

*Updates are ready?!*

In the beginning there was a client and a service. The client used the service, and was a satisfied user. There were many clients each with unique needs satisfied by the service. As the service expanded to serve more, specific needs had to be addressed and changes were made frequently. With so many clients, the service could no longer individualize assistance and changes were broadly released. Each user was frequently prompted to obtain the latest version for changes they did not benefit from.

The original client exacerbated, began his own service grounded on several fundamentals:

1. The service will only be successful to the extent that it is helpful
2. Only prompt/interrupt the user for an improvement of noticeable value

*He (E.E. Cummings) read his work as I have heard him read it on recordings. Dry. A brittle lyricism. No attempt to sell or underline the language. He treated it as factual.
-Roger Ebert*

My favorite teacher thus far guided students by asking questions, with the effect of demonstrating several natures of learning.

*The answer is often within us.*

The uncovering of the solution is the process of reasoning through the parts we already know. Additionally if the teacher leads by asking questions, what separates ourselves from the teacher?

*In the same way the teacher inquires, we can inquire likewise.*

Practically this entails: 

- asking oneself to explain the problem
- what must be true
- what paths of navigation can I make based on these truths

Sometimes when I ask people questions about what they mean. They try to give an answer, and often I find that they even are dissatisfied with their explanation. A typical reaction is like: It's hard to explain? Did that make sense? Am I communicating it clearly?

It seems to me the issue is not in the transmission of understanding, it's in the fundamental understanding.

These questions become a front / a social wall to hide one's lack of understanding.

Outside my work many vagrants inhabit the main shopping stretch by my campus. Occasionally I overhear their conversations; I'm always intrigued. I'm going to paraphrase because I do not remember it all. The man speaking is a bulking man with a soft countenance, think Lennie from Of Mice and Men.
