Ayn Rand is not popular. If you disagree with her work for reasons of your *own* conscience, it is not in vain. Nevertheless, these are the quotes that struck me. 

Roark denies Mrs. Wayne Wilmot's commission request

*Quietly, patiently, he tried to explain to her why she should not build a Tudor house...  He tried to explain and to convince. He knew, while he spoke that it was useless, because his words sounded as if they were hitting a vacuum. There was no such person as Mrs. Wayne Wilmot; there was only a shell containing the opinions of her friends ... it was this that he had to address, this immateriality which could not hear him or answer, deaf and impersonal like a wad of cotton.*

Peter Keating is announced victor of the Cosmo-Slotnick competition

*He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in those staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection.*

Peter and Dominique discuss Ellsworth's committees

*What do you really see that's so wrong with that meeting? After all, we're not planning to do anything definite. We don't have any actual program. I don't even know what we were there for.*

*That's it, Peter. You don't even know what you were there for.*

Ellsworth discusses with Kiki Holcombe about Dominique's reaction to Roark

*I think, Kiki, that every human soul has a style of its own, also. Its one basic theme. You'll see it reflected in every thought, every act, every wish of that person. The one absolute, the one imperative in that living creature. Years of studying a man won't show it to you. His face will.*

*That sounds Fantastic, Ellsworth. And unfair, if true. It would leave people naked before you ... Well what do you see in my face?*

*Oh ... yes ... well, tell me the movie stars you like and I'll tell you what you are.*

A reflection of Dominique as a hostess when she fought to keep Roark from building

*She listened to empty words uttered as if the speaker would be insulted by any sign of enthusiastic interest from his listener, as if only boredom were the only bond possible between people, the only preservative of their precarious dignity.*

An anecdote from Toohey's childhood regarding his character and avarice

*It happened that Pat Noonan offered Ellsworth a bag of jelly beans in exchange for a surreptitious peek at his test paper. Ellsworth took the jelly beans and allowed Pat to copy his test. A week later, Ellsworth marched up to the teacher, laid the jelly beans, untouched, upon her desk and confessed his crime, without naming the other culprit. Ellsworth remained silent; he explained that the guilty boy was one of the best students, and he could not sacrifice the boy's recored to the demands of his own conscience. Then the teacher had to drop the matter and let the test marks remain as they were. But it threw suspicion on ... all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey.*

Roark requests Mallory build the statue for the Stoddard Temple

*If you understand the building, you understand what the figure must be. The human spirit. The heroic in man. The aspiration and the fulfillment, both. Uplifted in its quest--and uplifting by its own essence. Seeking God--and finding itself. Showing that there is no higher reach beyond its own form...*

Toohey's discussion with Dominique with respect to his debasement of the Stoddard Temple

*No, you never ruin an architect by proving that he's a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he's an atheist, or because somebody sued him ... Reason can be fought with reason. How are you going to fight the unreasonable? The trouble with you, my dear, and with most people, is that you don't have sufficient respect for the senseless. The senseless is the major factor in our lives. You have no chance if it is your enemy. But if you can make it your ally--ah, my dear!*

Dominique defends Roark before the Stoddard case

*They were right. The Stoddard Temple is a threat to many things. If it were allowed to exist, nobody would dare to look at himself in the mirror. And that is a cruel thing to do to men. Ask anything of men. Ask them to achieve wealth, fame, love, brutality ... But don't ask them to achieve self-respect. They will hate your soul.*

Gail Wynand and Roark discuss the commission for his new house

*I've seen your buildings. The man who wants to tell you what a house should look like must either be able to design it better--or shut up. I'll say only that I want my house to have the Roark quality.*

Keating confronts Ellsworth feeling unhappy/invaluable

*You failed there, didn't you, Ellsworth? Look where he is now--Howard Roark.*

*... Mr. Howard Roark is a great temptation to me ... you can follow one of two procedures. You can devote your life to pulling out each single weed as it comes up--and then ten lifetimes won't be enough for the job. Or you can prepare your soil in such a manner--by spreading a certain chemical, let us say--that it will be impossible for weeds to grow. This last is faster ... The same technique of course, holds true in the case of any other living plant you may wish to eliminate: buckwheat, potatoes, oranges, orchids or morning glories.*

Gail Wynand overlooking Roark beyond his boat

*As he stood at the rail, watching Roark in the water, he thought of the power he held in this moment: he could order the yacht to start moving, sail away and leave that red headed body to sun and ocean. The thought gave him pleasure: the sense of power and the sense of surrender to Roark in the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power. Every physical instrumentality was on his side: a few contractions of his vocal cords giving the order and someone's hand opening a valve--and the obedient machine would move away ... Roark floating like a piece of driftwood,  held a power greater than that of the engine in the belly of the yacht. Wynand thought: Because that is the power from which the engine has come.*

Roark and Gail discuss the second hander

*That's because some sense of dignity always remains in them. They're still human beings. But they've been taught to seek themselves in others. Yet no man can achieve the kind of absolute humility that would need no self-esteem in any form. He wouldn't survive.*
