Mother is strong but her strength is faltering. She bore children who no longer bear her memory, and she weeps for those she used to cradle.

In our youth she was unmatched, uncontended, and firm. In those millenia love and respect were her source of strength. All that remains is a fickle semblance of that once eternal flame.

Mother is one who gives without receiving. Her children are well and that is enough. It is the sad fate of a mother neglected, who is left by the door waiting for dusk to trail in those who never return.

The hour is nigh, but I can still lay here and sift through the grass. Face into the dirt my head is tucked beneath her breast, clutching her memory, and gripping unto the life she is too weak to hold, the life which suckled man for ages.
