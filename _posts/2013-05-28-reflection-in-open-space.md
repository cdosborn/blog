Today I logged too many hours on my computer. I began programming the night before and I lacked the restraint to go to bed at a decent hour, which carried over to today also. I spent all of today staring into the flickering screen. It was fun, albeit short-lived with the issuance of a headache. After reaching a point of resolution, I left my room for some solace.

It appealed to me to head to a commons in a library nearby. I sat in a corner beside a fireplace mounted in glass. As I sat in a mildly populated space, I felt a strange pleasure. I did not immediately understand the source, and became pensive. I was engaging, if not passively, in the company of others in a unique way.

At the retail store where I work, I am required to engage people in coversation by greeting and farewell. It is this requirement which at times is a source of frustration. I must interact when I otherwise might not.  It also prompts an artificiality against my nature. It goes something like, 

"What can I help you find?"
>"I'm just looking."

The customer aptly evades my insincerity. There are other times where I establish rapport with a customer. I leave my role as an associate and become genuinely invested in the person behind the customer. After the sharing of conversation, without exception, "What can I help you find today?" will be returned in the genuine manner that it was delivered. A bond of trust exists, and the customer will likely disclose the reason behind the visit. Unfortunately, more often than not I experience insincere exchanges, in part due to the frequency and nature of retail encounters.

In this space, I have no obligation to intrude or feel compelled to engage in converstaions based on social courtesy. I feel acceptance and freedom. It is the absence of the these qualities which endows me with fondness for them. I am not anti-social as I do enjoy the presence and fellowship of people, but I dislike when I feel a necessity to betray how I would naturally act.
