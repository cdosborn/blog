I can name several areas of knowledge I would like to explore for any given time. Currently...

- BASH scripting
- JS / JS design patterns
- Server JS
- git

##Source of conflict

I find my understanding to be shallow in certain areas. I do not like _waisting_ time, so I quickly bounce from knowledge sources when I feel I have the answer that meets my immediate need. This is what I call _lightning learning_ (LL). It is intentionally short-term and shallow. LL has its place, and there are definite times where the alternative is far too time consuming and unecessary. However, I have made the unfortunate habit of relying on LL. 

##Resolution

For areas of knowledge that are important, I set apart time to learn correctly. I have found the greatest benefit in books that I read. For example, I make the mental assignment to read and finish a book within 4 days. It allows me to focus on the book as a whole, and have greater takeaways.
