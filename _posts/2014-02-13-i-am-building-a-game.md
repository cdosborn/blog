I am currently building/remaking a [game](http://cdosborn.github.io/superrun/). The previous code was so poorly fanagled the first time, that making the game was no longer fun. However, I spent a significant amount of time on the art and animations so I found it deserving of a redo! Currently there is no "purpose", this is intentional in two ways.  

1). It will never be finished

2). It's about exploring new things

I'm working on it at the [UW GameDev Club](http://students.washington.edu/gamedevc/)!.
