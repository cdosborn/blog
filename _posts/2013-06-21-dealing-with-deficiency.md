This is a discussion regarding what we are taught and what we discover about self-worth. My experience with public education frames my arguments. Albeit unintentional, I found it to be a major factor in my development. My intentions are that the narrow scope of my examples do not dilute the message.

If you are capable of seeing yourself as invaluable, cheers so long as it is devoid of pride. I find this hard to accomplish in an existence surrounded by value judgements. Our current society is infatuated with the manipulation of self-worth.

##my experience
If as individuals we lack a foundation as our source of value, we subject ourselves to a barrage of judgements. Namely those whimsical and rooted in artificiality. I will proceed to list a few. In early elementary:
>Were you fast? Could you catch a football? 

If not, it was understood you did not stand much chance ending up in major league sports. In high school: 
>What were your scores on your SAT? What colleges extended you acceptance? 

If prestigious schools did not accept you, you were not going to be successful. I happened to attend a prep school where sensitivity about academia was high. Nonetheless, various judgements will penetrate each depending on our circles and areas of participation. 

Junior high can be a particularly difficult time because our foundation of self-worth is so raw, contested, and infirm, compounded by an entirely unique set of judgements. It is the primary emergence of sexuality, which sets the criteria for the next stage of life, the attainment of those who engender attraction. As we age the criteria for self-worth changes. For some the definition extends to their profession, home, or sphere of friends, etc.

##propagating the issue

I found public education to be the great equalizer, in an atypical way. A way that suggests the equality of minds and abilities in the absence of deficiency. I have the impression that schools opt to make students feel confident about their abilities, overconfident. There is far too little focus on self development, namely grasping our weaknesses. No Child Left Behind enforced that schools ought to err on helping those beneath the bell curve, as if the greater threat to equality would be catering to the promising students making those below feel inferior. The culture is such that nobody should feel inferior *ever*. More importantly the feelings of inferiority are never addressed.

As a result, my foundation proved to be a weakness. Emergence into college admissions, job competition, and perhaps the "real world" painted a different impression. Effort is not always a substitute for ability. One person's strength is another's deficiency. There are people who are simply outrightly better at _______. Further there are some people who are *more* intelligent...
>\**gasp*

This is a sentiment a teacher never addresses.

I believe there are numerous forms of intelligence, and I do not think teachers ought to be diminishing students. I think the classroom's environment is a safe harbor for discussing difficult matters. Within myself I found that I am quick to spawn excuses. "The teacher is to blame." or "I am a different type of learner" or "I have test anxiety". Some may be valid, but we must be skeptical when excuses arise in our being. It is far more valuable to look within and be transparent about our deficiencies.

##progress
After contemplation, a natural response would be feelings of defeat, and less value, yet the only egalitarian principle of human nature is that nobody controls their gene set. The natural and innate abilities you possess were given arbitrarily. The athlete is not an athlete for how hard they worked for that bone structure. Each human is reduced to the deck of cards they are dealt. Perhaps the only metric that is fair is a measure against oneself. Do you live up to the greatness that is within you?

A healthy perspective embraces the shortcomings and talents, it appreciates that no one is truly equal. It is honest. The search for value is more appropriately a self embarked journey. Much of this train of thought I adopted from Rilke's emphasis on self discovery in his popular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394741048/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0394741048&linkCode=as2&tag=cdosborn-20" target=_blank>letters to a young poet</a>.

*"We have no reason to harbor any mistrust against our world, for it is not against us. If it has terrors they are our terrors, if it has abysses, these abysses belong to us; if there are dangers, we must try to love them ... then what now appears to us as the most alien will become our most intimate and trusted experience."*
*-Rainer Maria Rilke*
