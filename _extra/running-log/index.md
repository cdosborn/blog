I like to keep track of things, regardless of whether or not I revisit them. It is a tangible way for me to account my history. Nonetheless, this is running log in preparation for the marathon/2 on sept. 2nd.

7/20 32min 3mi

Today was bad. I ran way too far. I had to walk nearly the whole way back. I
have pain in my arches. There are muscles in my feet, that are really weak.

7/19 24min 2.5mi

After taking a rest yesterday, I felt really rested. I ate an hour before
running which was ideal. I could have ran 4mi w/o stopping but the person I
was running with was struggling.

7/17 35min 4.0mi

Due to being sore from the prev workout, I walked back for the last .5 mile.
Need to remember to eat after running, boost my sugar levels. I felt like I
was going to faint at work.

7/16 35min 4.0mi

Strange sensation after about 15 min, becoming really itchy. Never running
north at night again.
