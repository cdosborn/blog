I like to keep track of things, regardless of whether or not I revisit them. It is a tangible way for me to account my history. Nonetheless, this is a reading log of [the brothers karamazov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov) by fyodor dostoyevsky. Reading entries follow the pattern:

>As long as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it ... but when the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in its  little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were filling up the shalllow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the earth.

>>To insects-sensual lust.

>I am that insect, brother, and it is said of me especially. All we Karamazovs are such insects, and angel as you are, that insect lives in you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood ... a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.

>Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it's suffering he is seeking?

>...

>Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.

>If it were not for the Church of Christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil-doing, no real chastisement for afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases only embitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual one, the only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the recognition of sin by conscience.

Ivan challenges the relationship between church and state. He argues that the Romans tried to merge both, bringing the church into a pagan state. He argues that the state ought to be a part (extension) of the church. He states, "All this will not degrade it in any way or take from its honour and glory as a great State, nor from the glory of its rulers, buy only turns it from a false, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which alone leads to the eternal goal."

>MiÃ¼sov took a cursory glance at all these "conventional" surroundings and bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his own insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age in which a clever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously.

>Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. - Zossima

The Karamazov brothers meet in the monastery with Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Fyodor Pavlovitch makes a fool of himself compromising the emotions of Pyotr, who does not get along with Fyodor, all which is shameful to Aloysha. Ivan is inherently indifferent to the display in the cell. Dimitri notably missed the gathering.

>As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naÃ¯ve and
simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.

>And I will wait for you[Aloysha]. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who
has not condemned me. - Fyodor Karamazov

Aloysha is heading off to the monastery under the elder Zossima. He decided to
return home partly to visit the burial of his mother, and for another reason
not yet announced. He did so even at the expense of finishing his last year of
school.
