A weblog written by Connor Osborn. I began with the hope of purporting change and well-being into the world through expression of my thoughts, in turn realizing *this* is all for my self. If any being out there is evaluating the bits of *this* please contact me at cdosborn[at]uw.edu. Oh and a [photo](/images/profile.jpg) for the ladies.

*stream* is a part of the site for undeveloped thoughts. Inspired by Henry Precheur's [blog](http://henry.precheur.org/)

*posts* &emsp; consequently are the thoughts I spend time revising/passing through friend filters/etc.

*this*<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup> &emsp;  is a part of the site where I discuss myself and parts of this site (I just had to).
