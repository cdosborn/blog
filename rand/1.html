<p>An excerpt regarding the integrity of the web from it's designer</p>
<p>The Web, like the Internet, is designed so as to create the desired "end to end" effect ...  If the law of the land can respect this, and be couched in an "end to end" terms, such that no government or other interference in the mechanisms is legal that would break the end to end rules, then it can continue in that way.  If not, engineers will have to learn the art of designing systems so that the end to end functionality is guaranteed whatever happens in between.  What TCP did for reliable delivery ... cryptography is doing for confidentiality ... For the information space to be a powerful place in which to solve the problems of the next generations, its integrity ... is essential.  Its properties must be consistent, reliable, and fair, and the laws of our countries will have to work hand in hand with the specifications of network protocols to make that so. -Tim Berners-Lee</p>
